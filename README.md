#Description

This repository contains a collection of notebooks and files related to hard skills and data science libraries, including pandas, plotly, numpy, sql, nosql, dash, matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, web scraping and other popular libraries.  
The notebooks in this repository are designed to help me quickly recall important concepts and techniques, and to serve as a reference for future projects.
